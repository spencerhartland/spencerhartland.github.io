        <h1>Smart Coffee Scale<h1>
        <p>
          I love coffee! My typical day can include 3+ cups! I prefer espresso to
          filter coffee, and my drink of choice is an oat milk latte. Keeping in
          mind my habit for multiple cups a day... relying on coffee shops gets
          expensive. As such, I'm planning to buy an expresso machine!<br><br>
          Of course, I have to be nerdy about my coffee so I really wanted a
          fancy coffee scale like the Acaia Pyxis or Lunar, but I really don't
          want to pay for one. That's what lead me to this project: a smart
          coffee scale powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico W.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        So the goal for this project was to make a scale that emulated, as closely
        as possible, the Acaia Pyxis. The Pyxis is TINY: 65mm x 65mm x 13 mm.
        Designing a scale built from off-the-shelf components that fit into those
        dimensions was the biggest hurdle. Originally, the load cell I was using
        was slightly too large and forced me to increase my scale's dimensions to
        about 75 mm x 75mm x 15 mm. Fortunately, I managed to salvage a much
        smaller load cell from a kitchen scale I already owned! This allowed my
        design to meet the original goal of matching the Pyxis' dimensions.<br><br>
        As of now, the hardware is complete. Software is the easy part, so that
        should be coming soon (definitely before I buy my espresso machine!).

      <h2>Hardware</h2>
      <p>
        You can see above how the components are really packed into the scale.
        This size was difficult to achieve, but it will be worth it when
        it fits perfectly under the grouphead of an espresso machine!

      <h3>Size Comparison</h3>
      <p>Below, you can see how the salvaged load cell really enabled me to
        *scale* the size down. The new design is 53% smaller!</p>

      <h2>Work in Progress</h2>
      <p>
        Next step is to get the load cell calibrated and implement the firmware
        features beyond basic weighing. Still deciding if this truly *needs* an
        iOS or web interface.<br><br>
        This project is a work in progress! As such, this page will be updated
        somewhat often and things about the project might change. Also, any
        questions, tips, or suggestions are welcome. Feel free to send me an
