        <p>
            Physical is a digital catalogue of your music on physical media. Build your catalogue
            by adding the vinyl records, CDs, and cassettes you already own with help from Apple
            Music to fill in all the details. Plan new additions by adding the music you want and
            add new finds on the fly by scanning an item's barcode.
            <br><br>
            Physical also helps you share and discover new music with social features that allow
            you to browse friends' collections and post your favorite tracks or albums. This is
            social media designed for music lovers.
            <br><br>
            Physical is currently in development so this page will be updated frequently as I
            progress. Be sure to check back for the latest information on Physical's development!

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Physical is designed to be familiar for users of the defualt iOS Music app, intentional differences
        highlight that the app is purpose-built for cataloguing physical media. I've used a ton of system 
        components, icons, materials, and fonts to mimic the look and feel of Music while ensuring that Physical 
        is unique in its design to communicate its unique purpose.

      <h3>Technologies and frameworks</h3>
      <p>
        Targeting iOS 17, I used Physical as a way to explore all manner of newly introduced technologies and APIs.
        This is also the first time I've used AWS as my backend solution of choice. I've previously used Firebase,
        but I wanted the experience with AWS and the flexibility of building my own REST API from scratch. Here's
        a summary of some of the interesting tech included in Physical:
        <br><br>
        SwiftData provides intuitive data modeling and persistent local storage.
        <br><br>
        AWS provides backend services: S3 for storage of users' images, DynamoDB for other 
        user-generated data, and API Gateway / Lambda to tie it all together.
        <br><br>
        MusicKit provides search results and autofill functionality when adding new media to a user's collection.
        <br><br>
        SwiftUI provides tons of powerful system components, materials, colors, and fonts which make Physical feel
        right at home on iOS.
        <br><br>
        AsyncImage and asynchronous operations built using Swift's recently added async / await syntax ensure that
        the UI remains responsive even when data takes a while to download.
      </p>

    <div class=project-page-section>
      <h2>What's next?</h2>
      <p>
        The majority of the UI and local functionality is complete. As of now, media can be added and information
        (album art, title, artist, genre, release date, tracks, etc) is auto-populated by MusicKit. The
        collection can be sorted and filtered in myriad ways thanks to SwiftData, predicates, and sort descriptors.
        So right now, the app is ready to serve as a digital catalogue of just <i>your</i> music on Physical media,
        but what about friends?
        <br><br>
        Next up on the list of to-dos is adding media that you <i>want</i> but don't yet own, and then builing out
        the backend and social features.
