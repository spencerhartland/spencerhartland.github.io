        <h1>Automatic Dog Food Bowl<h1>
        <p>
          A smart food bowl powered by a Raspberry Pi running Linux. The device
          will automatically dispense an appropriate amount of food throughout
          the day using a NEMA17 steppper motor and a 3D printed auger
          mechanism. Dual 128x32 OLED displays allow interaction with the user
          and real-time food supply level monitoring via load sensors in the
          base. All non-electronic parts will be 3D printed.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Originally, this project was meant to be a simple retrofit of my dogs'
        (Kobe and Chile) current gravity-powered food bowl. I wanted to learn
        more about programming hardware like displays and motors, and Kobe was
        eating a little too much so we wanted to slow him down. The plan was to
        add a Raspberry Pi 4+, a motor with a 3D-printed feed mechanism, and a
        single display to their existing bowl.<br><br>As I gained experience in
        Fusion360 and began to work on the electronics, however, I realized I
        could do much more. I now believe the components list is final, and the
        design of the device should only need some minor tweaks to some parts
        before printing. This project is still a work in progress: as of right
        now, the electronics and software drivers for the displays are finished;
        the motor's software still needs some work; the feeder extrusion is
        fully printed and temporarily assembled with its display inside; the
        rest of the device still needs to be printed and assembled.<br><br>If
        you have any questions or suggestions regarding this project, send me an
        email!

      <h2>Displays</h2>
      <p>
        Why two displays? I wanted to have a display for interaction with the
        user of the device, but with this device there are two distinct users
        who need different types of interaction. The dogs are the obvious first
        user: they'll use the bowl to eat. The second user is me, the human.
        As a human, I'm interested in knowing how much food is in the supply
        chamber and when I need to fill it. Dogs are only interested in eating.
        <br><br>The display at the top of the device shows humans the current
        food level and indicates when to fill the chamber.<br><br>The display on
        the front of the feeder extrusion plays a simple animation to draw the
        attention of Kobe and Chile and notify them that food is about to come.

      <h3>Display 0 (human)</h3>
      <p>
        The video above shows the UI/animations for the human-facing display
        (the bare OLED). I've written a python script to demonstrate the
        functions of the display. First, you can see it cycle through food
        levels 4 (full) through 1 (empty). Second, you can see the animation
        intended to notify humans to fill the food supply chamber. Note: The
        scanning effect is not visible in real life, I couldn't eliminate it in
        video.
