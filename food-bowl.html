        <h1>Automatic Dog Food Bowl<h1>
        <p>
          A smart pet food bowl powered by a Raspberry Pi running Linux! The
          device is designed to automatically dispense a pre-determined amount
          of food at regular intervals throughout the day, eliminating worries
          of overeating and ensuring each meal is fresh and tasty. The companion
          iOS app enables on-demand snacks or meals, schedule customization, and
          remote monitoring.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Originally, this project was meant to be a simple retrofit of my dogs'
        (Kobe and Chile) current gravity-powered food bowl. Once I got started,
        however, I quickly got carried away adding features. Owing to that, my
        first foray into hardware has been an incredibly rewarding learning
        experience!<br><br>As of now, the electronics are complete. The iOS
        app is fully-functional and nearly complete, once I've implemented
        the auto feeding and food storage monitoring systems in the device's
        firmware, I'll be able to make those features functional in the app.
        The backend code (server.py) is working but still needs some work to be
        up to standard.<br><br>If you have any questions or suggestions
        regarding this project, send me an email!
      </p>

      </div>
      <h3>iOS App</h3>
      <p>You can check out all the code for the iOS app over on
      <a href="https://github.com/spencerhartland/auto_food_bowl_ios">GitHub</a>.
      The companion app for the newly-named cyberbowl is nearly finished!
      All features are complete, with the exception of schedule editing and
      food storage monitoring. Those features aren't complete on the backend,
      so I need to implement there first.<br><br>The app is written entirely in
      Swift / SwiftUI with no external dependencies. Communication with the
      device is handled over Wi-Fi: the app connects via local network and
      communicates with a RESTful API written in Python running on the Pi.
      Though not required to use the food bowl, the app enables on-demand
      feeding, remote monitoring, and rich customization.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Firmware</h3>
      <p>The firmware is also available on
      <a href="https://github.com/spencerhartland/auto_food_bowl_firmware">
        GitHub</a>. The README provides a more detailed discussion of the
        firmware's modules. In summary, each module is responsible for
        controlling a single hardware component. The server module is the most
        recently added, and is the backbone of the iOS companion app. The
        server is pretty basic, it utilizes socket networking to receive requests
        and send data back to the iOS app. As of now, the server API has
        endpoints which allow: a "quick dispense," a "full" dispense of as much
        food as is desired, turning the status LED on/off, setting the
        status LED color, and testing the connection.

      <h2>Electronics</h2>
      <p>
        As I said, this is my first-ever project involving hardware. I am using
        this project as an opportunity to learn as much as I can. At this point,
        I feel pretty comfortable working with new components and figuring
        things out as I go, so it's going pretty well!

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        The design is still up in the air, but is next on the to-do list. The
        design is meant to be modular so that each piece is small enough to fit
        on my printer's bed and print in a reasonable amount of time.<br><br>The
        photos below show possible designs for the lid assembly and feeder
        extrusion (which you can see printed above).

      <h3>Lid Assembly</h3>
      <p>
        The lid assembly has a channel built into it to allow cable management
        for the human-facing display.

      <h3>Feeder Extrusion Assembly</h3>
      <p>
        Here, cable management is again designed into the parts surrounding the
        display.
