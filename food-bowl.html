        <h1>Automatic Dog Food Bowl<h1>
        <p>
          A smart food bowl powered by a Raspberry Pi running Linux. The device
          will automatically dispense an appropriate amount of food throughout
          the day using a NEMA17 steppper motor and a 3D printed auger
          mechanism. Dual 128x32 OLED displays allow interaction with the user
          and real-time food supply level monitoring via load sensors in the
          base. All non-electronic parts will be 3D printed.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Originally, this project was meant to be a simple retrofit of my dogs'
        (Kobe and Chile) current gravity-powered food bowl. I wanted to learn
        more about programming hardware like displays and motors, and Kobe was
        eating a little too much so we wanted to slow him down. The plan was to
        add a Raspberry Pi 4+, a motor with a 3D-printed feed mechanism, and a
        single display to their existing bowl.<br><br>As I gained experience in
        Fusion360 and began to work on the electronics, however, I realized I
        could do much more. I now believe the components list is final, and the
        design of the device should only need some minor tweaks to some parts
        before printing. This project is still a work in progress: as of right
        now, the electronics and software drivers for the displays are finished;
        the motor's software still needs some work; the feeder extrusion is
        fully printed and temporarily assembled with its display inside; the
        rest of the device still needs to be printed and assembled.<br><br>If
        you have any questions or suggestions regarding this project, send me an
        email!

      <h2>Electronics</h2>
      <p>
        Why two displays? I wanted to have a display for interaction with the
        user of the device, but with this device there are two distinct users
        who need different types of interaction. The dogs are the obvious first
        user: they'll use the bowl to eat. The second user is me, the human.
        As a human, I'm interested in knowing how much food is in the supply
        chamber and when I need to fill it. Dogs are only interested in eating.
        <br><br>The display at the top of the device shows humans the current
        food level and indicates when to fill the chamber.<br><br>The display on
        the front of the feeder extrusion plays a simple animation to draw the
        attention of Kobe and Chile and notify them that food is about to come.
        <br><br>The wiring is not final and is for testing only. I'm using
        all-black wires for the aesthetic, of course. It's reminiscient of
        modern Mac internals.
      </p>

      <h3>I2C Multiplexer</h3>
      <p>
        In order to avoid I2C address conflict when controlling multiple
        displays via I2C with the Raspberry Pi, one must use a multiplexer. The
        TCA9548A from Adafruit has eight I2C channels, way more than enough for the
        two I'll be using here.

      <h3>Display 0 (human)</h3>
      <p>
        The video above shows the UI/animations for the human-facing display
        (the bare OLED). I've written a python script to demonstrate the
        functions of the display. First, you can see it cycle through food
        levels 4 (full) through 1 (empty). Second, you can see the animation
        intended to notify humans to fill the food supply chamber. Note: The
        scanning effect is not visible in real life, I couldn't eliminate it in
        video.

      <h3>Display 1 (dogs)</h3>
      <p>
        This video shows the animations for the dog-facing display
        (the OLED hidden inside the feeder extrusion). First, the display
        creates a glowing effect by blasting all pixels at full brightness and
        then turning down the brightness over a period of time, repeatedly.
        Next, the display shows a "glowdrop" animation that I intend to
        indicate food falling from the extrusion. The OLED has this rounded
        pill shape by being masked with some black vinyl. I wish I had used
        white, because the black is somewhat visible through the thin layer of
        PLA that blurs the screen's output.

      <h2>Software</h2>
      <p>
        You can check out all the code for this project over on
        <a href="https://github.com/spencerhartland/auto_food_bowl">GitHub</a>.
        I'll be sharing a few snippets here that relate to the UI and animations
        shown above.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>glowing_alert</h3>
      <p>
        This is the function that creates the glowing alert effect to notify the
        dogs of a meal.
      </p>
      <br>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/spencerhartland/247ca931f370db51509736ddf96f291b.js"></script>
      <br>
      <p>
        In order to create a smoother glowing effect, it starts off at 0%
        brightness and displays a series of bitmap images.
      </p>
      <br>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/spencerhartland/08c9332b721b2e61649b845c96c3742e.js"></script>
      <br>
      <p>
        This slowly fills the screen with more white pixels and, once it's full,
        the display scales brightness up to 100%. In effect, this extends the
        range of display brightness.<br><br>The rest of the animations – the
        glowdrop, the food levels, the empty food supply chamber alert – all
        fuction the same as this. A loop displays a series of bitmap images to
        create the animations.

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        I intended the design of the device to be simple, user-friendly, and
        modern. Many iterations led to the final design, and I think it both
        looks good and provides a lot of function. The design is meant to
        be modular so that each piece is small enough to fit on my printer's bed
        and print in a reasonable amount of time.<br><br>The photos below show
        the designs for the lid assembly and feeder extrusion (which you can
        see printed above).

      <h3>Lid Assembly</h3>
      <p>
        The lid assembly has a channel built into it to allow cable management
        for the human-facing display.

      <h3>Feeder Extrusion Assembly</h3>
      <p>
        Here, cable management is again designed into the parts surrounding the
        display.
